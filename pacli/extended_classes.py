        """Changes configuration settings of the basic or extended configuration file.

           WARNING: The basic configuration file contains many settings which may lead immediately to problems if changed.

           Usage modes:

           pacli config set LABEL VALUE -r [-e CATEGORY]

               Replaces the VALUE associated with LABEL in the basic configuration file or in a
               category CATEGORY of the extended configuration file.
               WARNING: If changing the parameters of the basic configuration file,
               the application may not work anymore! In this case you have to modify
               the file manually.
               (NOTE: In compatibility mode using the basic configuration file, the -r flag can be omitted.)

           pacli config set LABEL VALUE -e CATEGORY

               Adds a new setting (LABEL/VALUE pair) to the extended configuration file.
               The CATEGORY is mandatory.

           pacli config set LABEL -d -e CATEGORY [--now]

               Deletes a setting (LABEL and its associated value) in the extended configuration file.
               Use --now to really delete it, otherwise a dry run will be performed.

           pacli config set NEW_LABEL OLD_LABEL -m -e CATEGORY

               Modifies a label in the extended configuration file (OLD_LABEL gets replaced by NEW_LABEL).

           pacli config set [True|False] -c

               Enables (True) or disables (False) the compatibility mode.
               True and False are case sensitive.
               Compatibility mode will format all outputs of commands like 'vanilla' PeerAssets,
               and ensures the original commands and their flags work as expected.
               Please refer to the original PeerAssets README.

           pacli config set CATEGORY -f [--now]

               Flush (delete) the contents of an entire category. Requires --now, otherwise it will perform a dry run.
               Useful when switching to a new wallet file, to renew the 'address' category.

           Notes:

               The basic configuration settings 'network', 'provider' 'rpcuser', 'rpcpassword' and 'rpcport'
               need to match the configuration of the coin client and the network/blockchain used.
               They should only be changed if pacli is to be used with a different network (e.g. testnet instead of mainnet)
               or wallet file/data directory. Once the setting has been changed you can't work with the old settings.
               The errors can be only solved changing back the values manually in pacli.conf.
               The setting 'deck_version' should only be changed by developers, as currently only version 1 is used
               and otherwise it will lead to errors with decks.
               Changing 'production' setting to False will enable a test environment for test tokens/decks which is
               incompatible with normal decks, this should also only be changed by developers.
               To change from testnet to mainnet and vice versa, use the 'network' setting.

             extended: Use the extended configuration file.

            If P2TH addresses were named, they will be included in this list, otherwise not.
            NOTE: Due to an upstream bug, change addresses may not be shown. You may add the -a flag if this happens to access the wallet file directly (requires berkeleydb package, should be done only in safe environments because wallet data may be exposed to memory!).

        pacli address list -j

            JSON mode. Shows a (prettyprinted) JSON string of all stored addresses and all tokens.

        pacli address list -l [-b CHAIN]
        pacli address list -f [-b CHAIN]

            Shows only the labels which were stored.
            These modes only accept the -b/--blockchain and -k/--keyring additional flags.
            -f/--full_labels shows the labels with the network prefix (useful mainly for debugging).

          full_labels: Show only stored labels with network prefix (debugging option).
          named: Shows only addresses which were named with a label. Addresses which aren't part of the wallet are shown, but balances then cannot be retrieved.
          keyring: Uses the keyring of your operating system.
          coinbalances: Only shows coin balances, not tokens (faster). Cannot be combined with -j, -f and -l.
          blockchain: Only with -l or -f options: Show labels for a specific blockchain network, even if it's not the current one.
          json: JSON mode showing a JSON string, see Usage modes above.
          p2th: Show the P2TH addresses of all decks and all auxiliary P2TH addresses (can be a very long list).
          only_initialized_p2th: Shows P2TH addresses from initialized decks and auxiliary P2TH addresses stored in the wallet.
          include_all: Show all genuine wallet addresses, also those with empty balances which were not named. P2TH are not included.
          wallet: Show all wallet addresses, including P2TH addresses stored in the wallet (like a combination of -i and -o).
          everything: Show all wallet addresses and all P2TH addresses (like a combination of -i and -p), including those related to uninitialized tokens and auxiliary P2TH addresses, but even in this mode some change addresses may not be found. NOTE: If addresses are named and not part of the wallet, they are also shown but their coin balances cannot be retrieved.
          access_wallet: Access wallet file directly. May expose wallet data, so use only in safe environments. Shows also change addresses other modes sometimes don't find. Can be combined with all other flags except -b, -l and -f. Requires the berkeleydb Python package.

           The -a option shows all stored locators.
           Block locators show the heights of transactions to/from the addresses.

               pacli address cache ADDRESS -e [--force]

           Delete the state of the address ADDRESS.
           Add --force to really delete it, otherwise a dry run is performed.

               pacli address cache -p [--force]

           Prunes orphaned blocks, if one or various cached addresses' last processed block was orphaned.
           Add --force to really prune, otherwise a dry run is performed.

           Args:

             startblock: Block to start the cache process. Use this parameter if you know when the address was first used.
             blocks: Number of blocks to scan. Can be used as a positional argument. Default: 50000 blocks (ignored in combination with -c).
             chain: Scans without block limit (up to the whole blockchain). WARNING: Can take several hours up to days!
             force: Ignore warnings and proceed. See Usage modes.
             erase: Delete address entry in blocklocator.json. To be used when the locator data is faulty or inconsistent.
             prune_orphans: Prunes orphan blocks in blocklocator.json, see Usage section.
             quiet: Suppress output.

        """Lists transactions, optionally of a specific type (burn transactions and claim transactions).

        Usage modes:

        pacli transaction list [ADDRESS]

            Lists transactions sent and/or received by a specific address of the wallet.
            ADDRESS is optional and can be a label or an address.
            If ADDRESS is not given, the current main address is used.
            Can be slow if used on wallets with many transactions.
            With -w, all transactions sent or received by the wallet will be shown.
            NOTE: Due to an upstream bug, transactions involving change addresses may not be shown. You may add the -a flag if this happens to access the wallet file directly (requires berkeleydb package, should be done only in safe environments because wallet data may be exposed to memory!).

        pacli transaction list -n

            Lists transactions stored with a label in the extended config file
            (e.g. for DEX purposes).

        pacli transaction list DECK [-o [ORIGIN_ADDRESS]] -b [-u] [-w]
        pacli transaction list -b [-o [ORIGIN_ADDRESS]] [-w]
        pacli transaction list DECK [-o [ORIGIN_ADDRESS]] -g [-u] [-w]

            Lists burn transactions or gateway TXes (e.g. donation/ICO) for AT/PoB tokens.
            If -o is given, only show those sent from a specific ORIGIN_ADDRESS in the wallet.
            DECK is mandatory in the case of gateway transactions. It can be a label or a deck ID.
            In the case of burn transactions (-b), DECK is only necessary if combined with -u. Without DECK all burn transactions will be listed.
            ORIGIN_ADDRESS is optional. In the case -o is given without address, the main address is used.
            If -w is given, only transactions sent from wallet addresses will be shown.
            If no origin address nor -w is given, all burn/gateway transactions spending from and receiving to any address in your wallet, including P2TH, will be shown.
            NOTE: Due to an upstream bug, transactions involving change addresses may not be shown. You may add the -a flag if this happens to access the wallet file directly (requires berkeleydb package, should be done only in safe environments because wallet data may be exposed to memory!).

        pacli transaction list DECK [-o ORIGIN_ADDRESS] -c

            List token claim transactions.
            In standard mode, all claim transactions in the blockchain from all senders are shown.
            Alternatively they can be limited to those sent from wallet addresses (-w) or those sent from a specific ORIGIN_ADDRESS (-o) in the wallet.
            DECK can be a label or a deck ID.
            ORIGIN_ADDRESS is optional. In the case -o is given without address, the main address is used.

        pacli transaction list [RECEIVER_ADDRESS] -x [-o ORIGIN_ADDRESS] [-f STARTHEIGHT] [-e ENDHEIGHT]
        pacli transaction list DECK -x -g [-o ORIGIN_ADDRESS] [-f STARTHEIGHT] [-e ENDHEIGHT]
        pacli transaction list DECK -x -b [-o ORIGIN_ADDRESS] [-f STARTHEIGHT] [-e ENDHEIGHT]

            Block explorer mode: List all transactions between two block heights.
            RECEIVER_ADDRESS is optional. ORIGIN_ADDRESS is the address of a sender.
            STARTHEIGHT and ENDHEIGHT can be block heights or dates of block timestamps (format YYYY-MM-DD).
            -f and -e options are not mandatory but highly recommended.
            WARNING: VERY SLOW if used with large block height ranges!

            Notes:
            - In this mode, both ORIGIN_ADDRESS and RECEIVER_ADDRESS can be any address, not only wallet addresses.
            - To use the locator feature -l an origin or receiver address or a deck has to be provided.
            - The mode with DECK only works for AT and PoB tokens together with -g or -b options and tracks the burn or gateway address.

        pacli transaction list [DECK] [ADDRESS] -p PARAM

            Show a single parameter or variable of the transactions, together with the TXID.
            This mode can be combined with all other modes.
            Possible parameters are all first-level keys of the dictionaries output by the different modes of this command.
            If used together with --json, the possible parametes are the first-level keys of the transaction JSON string,
            with the exception of -c/--claims mode, where the attributes of a CardTransfer object can be used.

        Args:

          access_wallet: Access wallet database directly (use only in safe environments, may expose wallet data!). A custom data directory can be given after -a. Cannot be combined with -x, -c, -m nor -s and -r. Requires berkeleydb package. Slow.
          burntxes: Only show burn transactions.
          claimtxes: Show reward claim transactions (see Usage modes) (not to be combined with -x, -b, -g and -a).
          debug: Provide debugging information.
          end_height: Block height or date to end the search at (only in combination with -x).
          from_height: Block height or date to start the search at (only in combination with -x).
          gatewaytxes: Only show transactions going to a gateway address of an AT token.
          ids: Only show transaction ids (TXIDs). If used without -q, 100000 is the maximum length of the list.
          json: Show complete transaction JSON or card transfer dictionary of claim transactions.
          keyring: Use a label of an address stored in the keyring (not supported by -x mode).
          locator: In -x mode, use existing block locators to speed up the blockchain retrieval, while caching uncached blocks in the selected block interval. See Usage modes above. NOTE: No caching will be done if -l is used with the -f flag, because this combination could lead to inconsistent caching.
          zraw: List corresponds to raw output of the listtransactions RPC command (debugging option).
          mempool: Show unconfirmed transactions in the mempool or the wallet. Adding 'only' shows only unconfirmed ones (not in combination with -x).
          named: Show only transactions stored with a label (see Usage modes).
          origin: Show transactions sent by a specific sender address (only necessary in combination with -x, -b, -g and -c).
          param: Show the value of a specific parameter/variable of the transaction.
          quiet: Suppress additional output, printout in script-friendly way.
          sent: Only show sent transactions (not in combination with -n, -c, -b or -g). In block explorer mode (-x), it only works together with -w.
          received: Only show received transactions (not in combination with -n, -c, -b or -g). In block explorer mode (-x), it only works together with -w.
          total: Only count transactions, do not display them.
          unclaimed: Show only unclaimed burn or gateway transactions (only -b and -g, needs a deck to be specified, -x not supported).
          wallet: Show transactions related to addresses in the wallet. See Usage modes for combinations with other options (-n not supported).
          view_coinbase: Include coinbase transactions in the output (not in combination with -n, -c, -b or -g).
          xplore: Block explorer mode (see Usage modes).
          _value1: Deck or address. Should be used only as a positional argument (flag keyword not mandatory). See Usage modes above.
          _value2: Address (in some modes). Should be used only as a positional argument (flag keyword not mandatory). See Usage modes above.
